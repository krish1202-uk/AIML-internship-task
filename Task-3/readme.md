🏡 Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression
📌 Project Overview
This task involves implementing Linear Regression using a housing dataset to predict property prices based on key features.

🔧 Tools & Libraries Used
Pandas – Data preprocessing

Scikit-learn – Model training & evaluation

Matplotlib – Data visualization

🚀 Task Breakdown
✔ Load & clean dataset (housing.csv) ✔ Select relevant features (area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, parking) ✔ Split dataset into training & testing sets ✔ Train Linear Regression model on training data ✔ Evaluate model performance using MAE, MSE, R² Score ✔ Visualize actual vs predicted prices using Matplotlib
