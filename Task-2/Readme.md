 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Python  

 📌 Project Overview  
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Python to understand dataset features through **statistics and visualizations**. The analysis includes generating **summary statistics, histograms, boxplots, correlation matrices, and interactive visualizations** using Plotly to identify patterns and trends.  

 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used  
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for static visualizations)  
- **Plotly** (for interactive graphs)  

 🚀 Installation Guide  
Since **Plotly** is required for interactive visualizations, install it using the following command:  
```bash
pip install plotly
```

📂 What the Code Does
✔ Loads the dataset using Pandas ✔ Generates summary statistics (mean, median, std, etc.) ✔ Creates histograms & boxplots for numeric features using Matplotlib & Seaborn ✔ Displays a correlation matrix heatmap for feature relationships ✔ Uses Plotly to create interactive visualizations

🏃 How to Run the Script
1️⃣ Ensure your dataset file is in the correct location. 2️⃣ Open the terminal and navigate to the folder containing the script.
bash
cd path/to/your/project

3️⃣ Run the script using Python:
bash
python eda_script.py
Once executed, the script will generate various visualizations and statistical summaries to help explore the dataset efficiently. 🚀
