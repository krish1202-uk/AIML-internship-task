
ðŸš€ Classification with Logistic Regression
ðŸ“Œ Objective
The goal of this task was to build a binary classifier using logistic regression for breast cancer diagnosis using data.csv.

ðŸ”§ Tools Used
âœ… Scikit-learn â€“ Model training & evaluation âœ… Pandas â€“ Data preprocessing âœ… Matplotlib â€“ Visualization

ðŸ›  Steps Performed
âœ” Selected a binary classification dataset (data.csv) âœ” Performed data preprocessing (cleaning & feature selection) âœ” Converted categorical target (diagnosis) into binary values (Benign = 0, Malignant = 1) âœ” Split the dataset into training & testing sets âœ” Standardized features using StandardScaler for better model accuracy âœ” Trained a logistic regression model using Scikit-learn âœ” Evaluated the model using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score âœ” Tuned decision threshold & visualized results

ðŸŽ¯ Outcome
A logistic regression model was successfully built, trained, and evaluated for binary classification using breast cancer data. The model was assessed using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score, providing valuable insights into performance.
